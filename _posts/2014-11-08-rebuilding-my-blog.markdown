As some may observe, I removed some of my oldest posts. That's because they were written in portuguese, and
my blog is now in english. I will not translate them because I wrote them when I was starting my career
as a software engineer and think they're not as valuable as the ones in here.

I will keep writting about the coolest stuff I'm involved - all in english, and hope to enable comments very soon.

Thanks for reading.
